# Pitch Draft

The internet is not free. But due to our communication infrastructure, we mostly dont feel the direct cost.
In the developing world, this far from the truth.
In Nigeria, where between 81-95% access the internet on their mobile devices

//- paying month data bundles with their cell provider to use very meager data plans.
//The user pay for monthly data bundles and are very away of the costs of suing th internet.
[FACT]
 a user spends 12% of their income on data - paying on average $2.26 per GB. Now keep in mid that 90 million people in Nigeria live under $1.75 a day.
So what choices are available: browse facebook or pay for food. This is not a choice one should have to make.

I'm Innocent Obi Jr and my idea is Fiber. In truth, its less of an idea and more of a passionate vision of something than can be.
Fiber is an application layer middleware that supports the creation  of mobile mesh networks. 


We can provide connectivity in remote areas
We can provide low-cost environmental monitoring
We can supprot cheaper access to educaiton content.

With Fiber, we can move is the interaction with digital services onto a platfom capable of using new peer to peer technology and techniques to reduce data costs.


Join us in co-designing a highly local internet that is built for purpose with the hope of not just tackling the problem of connectivity, but also spur innovation the design of appropriate technology in the developing world. 



## Story

* Lack of accessibiluty and affordable stifles economic transformation

## Impact
* Lower cost of educaton and digital services
* More available income
* New tech that is performant on and offline
* innovation in digital services
*  Things like microwork, offline payments, etc

## Who
* 90 million in Nigeria that live under $1.90/day
* X tht consume MOOCs in Y
* Researchers in developing world needing access to America journals


## What
* P2P mesh software
* Plarform for digital exchange
* Fiber

# Why Now?
* Current tech innovation in Africa is not inclusive. Assumes internet access. Leapfrogging
* Leaving out a significant number
* We need new way that spur innovation that can reach everyone from the base to the point of the pyramid
* Digital natives. Increasing reliance in digital, but lack of enabling infrastructure.
* History of corruption, collusion, lack of transparency and rent-seeking. 



# Pitch Research

* Nigeria ranks 11th out of 57 African Countries with an average price of $2.22 for 1 Gigabyte(GB) of data. 
* Rwanda cheaped with average of $0.56 for 1 GB
* Zimbabew with $75.20 for 1 GB

* 99% of internet connections in Nigeria are via mobile [2]
* Nigeria ranked 7th globally for internet subscribers, ahead of the likes of Russia and Germany, with over 110 million monthly subscribers. [3]
* 81% of its internet traffic coming from mobile devices [3]
* In 2017, an estimated 92 million mobile subscribers spent an average of ₦197 billion on mobile data each month, translating to ₦2,141 per subscriber.[3]
* his might seem inexpensive when compared to other goods and services but is equivalent to 12% of the current national minimum wage of ₦18,000 and 7% of the proposed wage of ₦30,000.[3]
* According to the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), affordable data means that the cost of 1GB must not cost more than 2% of monthly income.[3]
* The cost of 1GB in Nigeria is roughly $2.78, compared to $2.33 in Rwanda, $3.63 in Ghana, and $5.99 in Gabon [3]
* Data in Nigeria is cheaper than most African countries, but that does not say much as data in Africa is more expensive than anywhere else in the world.[3]
* the high frequency of monthly renewals people go through [3]
* it’s not uncommon to hear complaints of data plans and subscriptions running shorter than their intended lifespan, even with minimal use, and irrespective of negligible background data.[3]
* One user complained that his 12GB subscription which usually lasted a month finished within two weeks, even though he used his Wi-Fi services once he got to work, where he spends most of the week. Users have regularly complained that although their data consumption habits have not changed, the amounts of times they subscribe in a month have increased.[3]

* Mobile networks charge an average of ₦4/SMS and 11kobo/second for every phone call. Talk-time per ₦100 is 14 minutes, excluding messages and other special packages, so ₦1,000 buys roughly 140 minutes of airtime. A WhatsApp call consumes 300kb of data/minute on 3G networks, so at ₦1,000/GB, a 3G user gets over 3,000 minutes of airtime. [3]
* Nigeria is the world’s poverty capital, with over 90 million people living under $1.90/day and even the new minimum wage of ₦30,000 ($83) would be one of the lowest in the world.[3]

* Nigeria must understand that access to mobile data is capable of transforming many aspects of Nigerian society. In addition to accelerated economic growth and fortified individual rights, affordable internet access can expand educational capacity for Nigeria, by making education cheaper and more available for its 13 million out-of-school children.

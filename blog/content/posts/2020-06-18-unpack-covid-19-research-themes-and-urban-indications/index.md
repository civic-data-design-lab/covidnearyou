## Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic brings broad and deep impacts worldwide, calling for all research efforts to tackle the uncertainty and urgency involving this novel virus. The new virus (SARS-CoV-2) with unknown pathogens, epidemiological characteristics, and transmission patterns, inevitably brings inconsistency, discrepancies, and debates among the science community. On the other hand, the rapid transmission speed and large scale of the infected population require some timely responses despite the above uncertainties.


On March 17th, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy launched a COVID-19 AI OPEN Research Dataset Challenge in a partnership with Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Microsoft Research, Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and National Institutes of Health. This challenge is hosted on Kaggle, an online community of data scientists and machine learning experts owned by Google. The published dataset contains more than 29,000 research articles (over 13,000 with full text) on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 clinical studies, public health response, population characteristics, and epidemiology. Each publication has been parsed into separate JSON files with its metadata, authors’ information, abstract, and full manuscript.


The core challenge is to utilize data science and machine learning for better collection, organization, and audition of surging manuscripts. This data exploration aims to unpack the domains and progression of COVID-19 related studies by unpacking currently available research publications. We adopt both quantitative and qualitative methods from computer science and urban planning. Its goal is to stimulate interdisciplinary discussion and research collaboration, and support more inclusive approaches to address some immediate and long-term problems. We first summarize a retrospective overview of COVID-19 research challenges and progression in the data science community through this Kaggle challenge. Text analysis and visualization identify several key findings and critical factors that are highly relevant to COVID-19.

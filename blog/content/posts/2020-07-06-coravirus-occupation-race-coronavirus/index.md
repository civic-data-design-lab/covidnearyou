The connection between COVID-19 and the health of the economy is obvious. But, the direct cause & effect relationship is an intricate thing to measure, because it is neither one-dimensional nor unidirectional. The influence of one on the other is distorted with each pass through America's heterogeneous social fabric, like light passing from air to water.

Here are two potent maps illustrating this asymmetrical relationship. First is an animated map of daily new coronavirus cases per capita in the U.S. since January.

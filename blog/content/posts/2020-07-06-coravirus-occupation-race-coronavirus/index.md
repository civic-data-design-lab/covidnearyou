The connection between COVID-19 and the health of the economy is obvious. But, the direct cause & effect relationship is an intricate thing to measure, because it is neither one-dimensional nor unidirectional. The influence of one on the other is distorted with each pass through America's heterogeneous social fabric, like light passing from air to water.

Here are two striking animated maps illustrating this asymmetrical relationship. First is a map representing daily new confirmed coronavirus cases per capita in the U.S. by county from March 1, 2020 to July 6, 2020 (a one-week trailing average to account for regular fluctuations).

*Map 1. Daily new confirmed coronavirus cases per capita (one-week trailing average), United States, 3/1/2020-7/6/2020. Produced with QGIS and Photoshop.*

Here it was important to represent cases in the vertical dimension as well as choropleth fill to highlight counties both large and small.

This second animated map portrays the unemployment rate by county from Feb. 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases unemployment figures for each month, which we assign to the first day of the following month and approximate linearly for all other days. Preliminary figures for May were released last week. Figures for Puerto Rico are not available for April or May, so the territory was not included here.

*Map 2. Unemployment rate, United States, 2/1/2020-6/1/2020. Produced with QGIS and Photoshop.*

Scrutinize these two maps in close comparison with each other. Their timeframes are off by one month, but they cover the recent surges in each variable. Notice the incredible differences in the regions most affected by coronavirus (and in what order) versus those affected by high unemployment.

Coronavirus cases per capita first peaked in a handful of urban hot-spots (New York, NY; New Orleans, LA; Detroit, MI; Cincinnati, OH; Albany, GA), then spread to an entirely different set of rural hot-spots (the Oklahoma panhandle; Iowa and Southern Minnesota; Northeast Arizona; and several extreme spikes in the Midwest and South), and finally experienced a surge across the entire Sun Belt which is still ongoing.

Unemployment, meanwhile, demonstrated a ubiquitous surge across the entire country, with Las Vegas, NV, and the entirety of Hawai'i and Michigan particularly impacted.

Why do we witness these regional differences, if coronavirus is the clear precursor to the economic crisis? Beginning our inquiry from these maps leads directly to some initial hypotheses.

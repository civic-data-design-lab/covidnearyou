All analyses tracking the regional spread of coronavirus must define a starting point, when a certain early condition triggers the forward measurement of time. That starting point cannot be as simple as the first confirmed COVID case, firstly because testing in the early stage of an outbreak is sparse, and secondly because the progression of the first few infections is tied to the randomness of individualsâ€™ daily interactions.

In New York state, coronavirus [may have arrived more than one month before the first confirmed case](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6922e1.htm?s_cid=mm6922e1_w) on March 1, 2020. There, fatalities soared from 1 to nearly 500 in two weeks. Conversely, the Norfolk-Newport News area of Virginia had still not witnessed ten deaths 30 days after its first.

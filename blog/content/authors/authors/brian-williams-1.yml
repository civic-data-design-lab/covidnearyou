bio: Hey! I’m an aspiring protein engineer, who's actively looking for ways to
  uplift marginalized communities everywhere. I am a rising junior at MIT,
  majoring in Biological Engineering and minoring in Black Studies, and am
  looking forward to working in the Civic Data Design Lab this summer! So far, I
  have been analyzing and visualizing data reports on racial and ethnic data
  tied to COVID-19 test results and related deaths. In this project, I’m hoping
  to explain the confusing (and not so surprising) trends in the data and shed
  light on the reasons why discrepancies exist between states when reporting
  race in COVID-19 tests and deaths. Why is there missing data here, and what
  does this tell us? About testing strategies? About practicality? About
  policy?  I am passionate about understanding how policy decisions drive
  economic and social change. As an avid creative, I love to model and write
  poetry, and I play varsity baseball at MIT.

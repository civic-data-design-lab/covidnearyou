name: Amy Fang
bio: "I graduated from MIT in 2020, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and
  minoring in Anthropology and Design. In my semester, I took my first urban
  planning class,11.158 Behavior and Policy: Connections in Transportation,
  which has catalyzed a newfound fascination for all things behaviorally
  irrational (yet undeniably human) and excessively complicated. During this
  time, I became engaged to NUMTOT in a whirlwind romance, who helped her expose
  the inequitable safety misperceptions of shared micromobility.  Today, I
  fulfill my insatiable hunger for urban planning through mouthwatering memes,
  palatable PDF readings from classes I will never take, and spicy opportunities
  like the Missing Data Project. My first project investigates contradictory
  policies on the county, state, and national levels, specifically in the realm
  of everyday COVID-19 public safety practices. Just like my “missing” data
  sources, she thrives in ambiguity."

name: Tess McCann
bio: Tess is a current Master in City Planning candidate at MIT in the
  Department of Urban Studies and Planning. At MIT, she is researching the use
  of history and historic buildings in large-scale urban developments and hopes
  to write her thesis on the topic. She enjoys reading critical cartographic and
  psychogeographic theory, and in her spare time makes maps in this
  tradition.  Before MIT, Tess worked at Pentagram Design as a project manager
  and strategist. She had the pleasure of working with the Brearley
  Communications, Admissions, and Development Departments on the new admissions
  and capital campaign materials in 2016 and 2017. In addition to working with
  Brearley, she oversaw the development of logos and other design assets for
  Yale University (her other alma mater), Mastercard, the American Museum of
  Natural History, the Poetry Foundation, the Broad Institute of MIT and
  Harvard, and Central Park Conservancy.  Tess graduated with honors from Yale,
  where she holds a bachelor’s degree in history, with a specific focus on 19th
  Century German militarism. Her thesis was a historiographical biography of the
  German general Helmuth von Moltke, and included original translations of
  official German records that are held in the Yale libraries. In 2014, she won
  the Acheson Prize, Yale’s top award for written academic work for her essay,
  'The Historiography of Postwar and Contemporary Histories of the Outbreak of
  World War I'. She continues to practice her German, though admittedly it’s a
  bit eingerostet.
